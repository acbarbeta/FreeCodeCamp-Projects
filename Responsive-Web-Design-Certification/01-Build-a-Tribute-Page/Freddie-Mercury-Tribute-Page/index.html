        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p>Farrokh Bulsara <strong>(5 September 1946 – 24 November 1991)</strong>, known as Freddie Mercury, was a British singer, songwriter, and record producer. He is regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music due to his work as lead vocalist of Queen. Mercury had a notorious four-octave vocal range and a theatrical style, and wrote many of Queen’s greatest hits, such as “Killer Queen”, “Bohemian Rhapsody”, “Somebody to Love” and “Don’t Stop Me Now”. </p>

        <h2> Biography </h2>
        <p>Farrokh Bulsara was born in Stone Town in the British protectorate of Zanzibar, now part of Tanzania, on <strong>5 September 1946</strong>. He had four supernumerary incisors, to which he attributed his enhanced vocal range. Bulsara, later called Mercury, spent most of his childhood in India, where he started taking piano lessons at seven years old.</p>
        <p>Mercury’s first band was called the Hectics, formed when he was 12. His talent was remarkable. In fact, a friend recalls that he had the ability of reproduce on piano what he had just heard on the radio.</p>
        <p>In 1964, Freddie and his family moved to England, where later, in 1970, he would team up with <strong>Brian May</strong> (guitarist) and <strong>Roger Taylor</strong> (drummer) to form the band Smile. In 1971, <strong>John Deacon</strong> (bassist) joined them and <strong>Queen</strong>, one of the greatest bands alive, was born</p>
        <p>In the early 1970’s, Mercury had a long-term relationship with <strong>Mary Austin</strong>, whom he met through Brian May. They lived together for several years. In 1976, he told her about his bisexuality, fact that ended their romantic relationship. Nevertheless, Mercury and Austin remained friends until the end of his life, she being referred by Freddie as his only true friend.</p>
        <p>In the middle 1980’s, Freddie began another long-term relationship with <strong>Jim Hutton</strong>, whom he referred as his husband. They lived together for the last seven years of Mercury’s life and Hutton nursed him during his illness, being present at the moment of his death.</p>
        <p>According to Jim Hutton, Freddie was diagnosed with HIV in 1987, although the singer denied it until almost the end of his life. Around that time, there were rumors pursued by the British press about Mercury’s illness, due to his appearance and Queen’s absence from touring. Freddie Mercury’s last public appearance was on the stage of the 1990 Brit Awards.</p>
        <p>The singer preferred to keep his condition private to protect himself and people close to him, but informed his inner circle of friends – including the band – much earlier than the rumors became serious.</p>
        <p>Near the end of his life, Mercury was unable to leave his bed. On 22 November 1991, he called Queen’s manager <strong>Jim Beach</strong> and asked him to prepare a public statement, released the next day:</p>
        
        <p class="citation">"Following the enormous conjecture in the press over the last two weeks, I wish to confirm that I have been tested HIV positive and have AIDS. I felt it correct to keep this information private to date to protect the privacy of those around me. However, the time has come now for my friends and fans around the world to know the truth and I hope that everyone will join with me, my doctors and all those worldwide in the fight against this terrible disease. My privacy has always been very special to me and I am famous for my lack of interviews. Please understand this policy will continue."</p>
        <p>On the evening of <strong>24 November 1991</strong>, Mercury died at the age of 45 in his home. The cause of death was bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS. By the morning of 25 November, the news reached television and newspaper. Freddie Mercury’s funeral service was on 27 November 1991 and was attended by his family and another 35 of his close friends. He was cremated and the remains were given to Mary Austin, as a Freddie’s wish, to burry in an undisclosed location.</p>

        <h2> Artistry </h2>
        <p> Mercury’s speaking voice was in the baritone range, but most of his songs were on the tenor range. His vocal range was notorious, extended <strong>from brass F2 to soprano F6</strong>. Indeed, he could belt up to tenor F5. Furthermore, he had an enviable technique and a perfect coloratura. </p>

        <p>Ten of the 17 songs on Queen’s Greatest Hits album were wrote by Freddie: “Bohemian Rhapsody”, “Seven Seas of Rhye”, “Killer Queen”, “Somebody to Love”, “Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy”, “We Are the Champions”, “Biclycle Race”, “Don’t Stop Me Now”, “Crazy Little Thing Called Love” and “Play the Game”. In 2003, he was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame along with the rest of the band. It is notable that he involved a wide range of genres in his songs, such as heavy metal, gospel, disco and rockabilly. Mercury also wrote musically complex material, for example, “Bohemian Rhapsody, with a non-cyclical structure that comprises dozens of chords. In this song, he also established a bridge between classical and lyrical music and rock’n’roll.</p>
        <p>In his live performances, he also was a complete artist. Always displaying a highly theatrical style and encouraging public participation, as in Radio Gaga chorus or his interactive performance with Ay-Oh and response of the audience. His main and most remarkable prop on stage was a broken microphone stand. As one of Mercury’s most notable performances with Queen, <strong>Live Aid</strong>, in 1985, can be cited, being even voted as the greatest live performance in the history of rock music.</p>
        <p>Besides an excellent singer, Freddie was also a great pianist, starting his studies in his childhood in India. Often, he played piano in Queen’s most popular songs such as “Killer Queen”, “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Don’t Stop Me Now”. He also had rudimentary skills on guitar, writing many lines for the instrument.</p>
        <p> Mercury also recorded two solo albums and several singles, although his solo work was not as commercially successful as most Queen albums. His two albums were Mr. Bad Guy (1985) and Barcelona (1988). The last one was recorded with the Spanish soprano Montserrat Caballé and combines elements of popular music and opera. Besides all of that, Freddie recorded many tracks with another artists, such as Michael Jackson and David Bowie. </p>

        <p>Mercury is regarded as one of the greatest voices in the history of rock music. After his death, in 1995, he appeared posthumously on Made in Heaven, Queen’s final studio album that contains Mercury’s unreleased final recordings from 1991, some others from previous years, and reworked versions of solo works by the other members. Specially, the album contains “Mother Love”, Freddie’s last vocal recording. He never finished the song. After completing the penultimate verse, he told the band he was not feeling well, so he would finish when he came back the next time. He never did. So, the band finished the song later, adding instrumental track and with Brian May singing the last verse.</p>
        <p>In April 1992, the remaining members of Queen organized The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for AIDS Awareness, to celebrate the life and legacy of Mercury and raise money for AIDS research. The tribute concert took place at London’s Wembley Stadium and featured many guests, including Robert Plant, Roger Daltrey, Extreme, Elton John, David Bowie, Annie Lennox, George Michael, Elizabeth Taylor, Guns N’ Roses, Tony Iommi, Def Leppard, Seal, Liza Minnelli and U2.</p>
        <p>In 2018, the film Bohemian Rhapsody was released, starring Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury. Bohemian Rhapsody tells the history of Freddie Mercury and Queen until the Live Aid concert, although there were some historical inaccuracies.</p>
